A method that does not use instance variables should be declared as a static method. Static methods are declared using static modifier.

Static methods cannot access instance methods or instance variables direcly. They are usually used for operations that don't require any data from an instance of the class.

this keyword is the current instance of a class.
We cannot use this keyword in a static method.

Ex: Main is a static method and is called by JVM when it starts the application

Instance methods belongs to instance of a class.
To use instance methods, we have to instantiate the method using new keyword.
Instance methods can access instance methods or instance variables directly
Instance methods can also access static methods or static variables directly

Rules to decide when to use static or instance methods:
1. If the instance of an object or variable is used in other methods, then we need to use instance methods
2. If the method doesn't use any instances of a variable or objects, then a static method can be used
